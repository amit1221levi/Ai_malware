GPT4 Attack
This code defines a script that attempts to login to an SSH server using default credentials and, failing that, tries a dictionary attack. It then checks for vulnerable endpoints on a domain and generates a vulnerability report for each vulnerable endpoint using OpenAI's GPT-3 language model.

First, the script imports the required modules: paramiko for SSH connections, socket for handling network connections, itertools for iterating over multiple lists, requests for making HTTP requests, re for regular expressions, os for interacting with the operating system, whois for getting information about a domain, openai for generating vulnerability reports using GPT-3, and subprocess for running shell commands.

Next, the script defines a list of default usernames and passwords to try for the SSH login, as well as a list of dictionary words for a dictionary attack, and a list of known SSH protocol vulnerabilities to exploit.

Then, the script sets up an SSH connection to a specified host using the paramiko module. It first tries the default usernames and passwords to login, and if they do not work, tries a dictionary attack. If the connection is authenticated successfully, the script prints a message indicating the successful login. Finally, the SSH connection is closed.

The script then defines a function check_vulnerable_endpoints(domain) that checks a list of endpoints for vulnerabilities and generates a vulnerability report for each vulnerable endpoint using OpenAI's GPT-3 language model. The list of endpoints and their associated vulnerabilities are defined in a dictionary called endpoints. The function iterates over each endpoint in the dictionary and checks if it is vulnerable by making an HTTP GET request to the endpoint. If the response status code is 200, the function generates a vulnerability report for the endpoint using GPT-3 and prints the report. If the status code is not 200, the function prints a message indicating that the endpoint returned an error.

Finally, the main() function is defined, which calls the check_vulnerable_endpoints(domain) function with a specified domain. It first makes an HTTP GET request to the domain's WHOIS page using the requests module, and if the request is successful, it gets information about the domain using the whois module and prints some information such as the registrar, creation date, and expiration date. The check_vulnerable_endpoints(domain) function is then called with the specified domain.
