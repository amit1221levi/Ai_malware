Dont use this code for non ethical purposes , and take in account the results of using this code its on your self responsibility and high recommended 
to not use this code if you are not familiar with the possibles scenarios.

!Add break human operation  in the loop for prevent not required behaviours of the model or token loop who will create extra charging.
!Dont connect to Auto-GPT what can create unexpected and illegal behavors of your code

'''
This code is written in Python and implements a Red Team Assessment, which is a type of simulated cyber attack used for testing the security of an organization's networks and systems. The code utilizes several APIs and libraries, such as OpenAI, Google's Sentiment Analysis API, and pymongo, to carry out the assessment.

The code sets up API keys for Shodan, OpenAI, and Have I Been Pwned (HIBP), and initializes the OpenAI API by setting its API key. It also connects to a MongoDB database, which will be used to store the conversations (input, summary, and output) generated during the assessment.

The code defines the API endpoint and API key for the sentiment analysis API, and uses the Google API to analyze the sentiment of the input text. The code generates a summary of the input text based on the sentiment score returned by the API.

The code also integrates with the OpenAI API to generate responses based on the input and memory keys. The memory keys are generated based on the sentiment score of the input text.

The code defines a class, RedTeamAssessment, which performs the red team assessment. The class has several methods, including run_assessment, reconnaissance, vulnerability_scanning, web_application_scanning, dns_enumeration, subdomain_enumeration, and send_phishing_email. These methods carry out various steps of the red team assessment, such as reconnaissance, vulnerability scanning, web application scanning, and phishing.

The code also has a loop_decisions method that makes decisions on whether to proceed with the phishing attack. This method retrieves the stored data from the MongoDB database, summarizes the data using the sentiment analysis API, and generates a prompt for OpenAI. The decision is then made based on the summarized data and the output from OpenAI.

In general, the code is not inherently dangerous, but the results of the Red Team Assessment may highlight potential security vulnerabilities that need to be addressed. It's important to carefully consider the potential impact of running such an assessment and to only run it in a controlled environment with proper consent from the parties involved.
